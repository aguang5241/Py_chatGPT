üëâüèª ***Note:*** 
* If there is no sound, you may need to install the [***FLAC***](https://xiph.org/flac/download.html) command line tool and add it to the system path.

* For MacOS users:

    * If you cannot open the `Super_Assistant.app` file, you may need to do the following steps:
        1. After downloading the `Super_Assistant.app.zip` file, unzip it with `Unarchiver`. ***Note:*** Please do not use the `Archive Utility`, that will cause the `Super_Assistant.app` file to be damaged.
        2. The first time you run the `Super_Assistant.app` file, you may see the following error message `"Super_Assistant" cannot be opened`.
        3. Go to Terminal and run the following command:
        ```bash
        xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Super_Assistant.app
        ```
        4. Then you can run the `Super_Assistant.app`.
        5. If you get the error message `FLAC conversion utility not available - consider installing the FLAC command line application by running apt-get install flac or your operating system's equivalent` when you are recording, you may download and use `Super_Assistant` Unix executable file instead.

    * If you cannot open the `Super_Assistant` Unix executable file, you may need to do the following steps:
        1. The first time you run the `Super_Assistant` Unix executable file, you may see the following error message `"Super_Assistant" cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer`. Go to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Open Anyway`. After that you may see the following error message `macOS cannot verify the developer of ‚ÄúSuper_Assistant‚Äù. Are you sure you want to open it?`, please click `Cancel`.
        2. Then go to Terminal and run the following command:
            ```bash
            chmod +x /path/to/Super_Assistant
            ```
        3. Then you can run the `Super_Assistant` Unix executable file.
